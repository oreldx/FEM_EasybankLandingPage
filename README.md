# Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Frontend Mentor Easybank landing page challenge!

This project was built using basic HTML, CSS (with utility classes), and JavaScript. The goal of the project was to create a responsive landing page for a fictional online bank. This is my second responsive website approach, my first one was made with a tutorial by Kevin Powell. For more information on my first approach, please check out [my other repository](https://github.com/oreldx/FEM_ManageLandingPage).

## Layout

The layout of the landing page was designed to be clean and user-friendly, with clear calls to action and intuitive navigation. The page is fully responsive and adjusts to different screen sizes.

## CSS

The CSS has been written using utility classes to keep the code organized and maintainable.

## JavaScript

The JavaScript code was used to add some basic interactivity to the page, such as the toggling of the mobile menu.

## Conclusion

I hope you find this project helpful and informative! If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Enjoy!
